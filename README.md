# This Repository is DEPRECATED

This was the official Toolbox repository for Madeira's consultant team, for "as-is" solutions and tools/scripts that the team publishes.

Since March 2024, this repository has been **CLOSED** to further changes, in favor of SPLITTING it into 3 new repositories separated by fields of specialization:

- Database Administrators: [MadeiraToolbox\microsoft-dbas-club](https://github.com/MadeiraData/microsoft-dbas-club)
- Data Engineers: [MadeiraToolbox\microsoft-data-engineers-club](https://github.com/MadeiraData/microsoft-data-engineers-club)
- Data Analysts: [MadeiraToolbox\microsoft-data-analysts-club](https://github.com/MadeiraData/microsoft-data-analysts-club)

Please subscribe to those new repositories instead â™¥.
